## Graphite engine source code

Graphite2 is a rework of the original Graphite engine that is faster, smaller, and uses an API that is better suited to the layout architecture of most text-processing applications.

The Graphite compiler is a tool that is used to compile together a TrueType font and GDL program describing font behaviors into a Graphite-enabled font.

The package includes the program and various documentation files, such as a description of the Graphite font tables, debugger file documentation, a formal GDL grammar, etc.
