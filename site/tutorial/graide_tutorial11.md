# Unit 11: Glyph metrics

[Exercises](graide_tutorial11#exercise-11)

## Discussion

To position glyphs correctly, it is often necessary to make use of the glyphâ€™s metrics from within the font. Glyph metrics are numeric values for standard measurements defined for each glyph within the TrueType font. The following metrics can be used in a GDL program:

* `boundingbox.top` (`bb.top`)
* `boundingbox.bottom` (`bb.bottom`)
* `boundingbox.right` (`bb.right`)
* `boundingbox.left` (`bb.left`)
* `boundingbox.height` (`bb.height`)
* `boundingbox.width` (`bb.width`)
* `advanceheight` (`ah`)
* `advancewidth` (`aw`)
* `leftsidebearing` (`lsb`)
* `rightsidebearing` (`rsb`)
* `ascent`
* `descent`

Useful abbreviations (as defined in **stddef.gdh**) are shown in parenthesis. Note that `ascent` and `descent` are not metrics of an individual glyph but of the font as a whole.

## Exercise 11

Use shifting and/or kerning to position diacritics over lowercase vowels. The diacritics should be attached to the previous base character. Here are some diacritics to include:

* grave -  U+0300 (glyph #250)
* acute -  U+0301 (glyph #247)
* circumflex -  U+0302 (glyph #253)
* tilde -  U+0303 (glyph #267)
* macron -  U+0304 (glyph #281)
* diaeresis -  U+0308 (glyph #290)
* hacek -  U+030C (glyph #264)

What is required to position them correctly over base characters of widely different widths and heights (eg, m vs. l)?

What is necessary to handle diacritics that have overstriking built in to their glyph metrics?

What is necessary to render i and j correctly with diacritics? (Hint: other glyphs you may find useful include: dotless i [glyphid 194] and dotless j [glyphid 195]).

Hint: instead of including numbers directly in the rules, define glyph attributes indicating the amounts by which to shift. You may also need to define a glyph attribute on the base characters as well as the diacritics being positioned. To access glyph attributes for a slot in the rule other than the one being shifted, use the following syntax:

```
@slot-number.glyph-attr
```

### Exploring Graide: non-ASCII text data

If you do not have a keyboard installed that allows you to conveniently type diacritics or other non-ASCII characters, you can enter them into your Graide test data using Unicode codepoints. The syntax is

```
\u<USV>
```

For instance, to enter X + diaeresis, type the following as test data: `X\u0308`. (Do not leave any space after the X.)

If you prefer to always see the Unicode codepoints for non-ASCII data, there is a flag in the Configuration properties dialog to indicate this. Open the section called **User Interface** and check the box labeled **Display character entities**.

### Exploring Graide: Glyph and Slot tabs revisited

Run the following data: `m\u0304 I\u0304`. Use the Glyph tab to compare the values of the glyph attributes for m and I. Use the Slot tab to compare the amounts by which the diacritic was shifted.
