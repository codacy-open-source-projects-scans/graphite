# Unit 8: Slot attributes

## Discussion

Unlike glyph attributes, which are constant for every instance of a given glyph, the values of slot attributes may differ for each instance of a glyph. It is the glyphâ€™s role as a slot within the context of the entire stream of text that determines the values of its slot attributes.

Slot attributes are set within rules. Most slot attributes are system-defined (and will be discussed further on), but there is also a set of user-definable (that is, programmer-definable) slot attributes, called user1, user2, etc. More meaningful names can be given to the user-definable attributes using #define.

Slot attributes can be tested in the context of the rule in the same way that glyph attributes are.
